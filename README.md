> **Cokra** - AI Agent Team CLI Environment (Codex 1:1 Replica)

Cokra is a 1:1 architectural replica of [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), an AI-powered agent team system for autonomous coding and collaboration.

## 🎯 Project Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - This project is in its initial setup phase.

## 📋 What is Cokra?

Cokra is an AI agent team CLI environment that enables:

- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Spawn and manage specialized AI agents
- **Tool Integration** - 20+ built-in tools (shell, file operations, MCP, etc.)
- **MCP Protocol Support** - Model Context Protocol server/client
- **Terminal UI** - Interactive terminal-based interface (ratatui)
- **Cross-Platform** - Linux, macOS, Windows support

## 🏗️ Architecture
